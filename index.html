<h1>she never need a man, she what man need</h1>

<p1>Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me</p1>
